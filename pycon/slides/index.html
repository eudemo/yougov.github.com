<h1>Scaling Python for High-Load Web Sites</h1>
<h3>David Shoemaker &amp; Jamie Turner</h3>
<h4>Polimetrix, Inc.</h4>
	<div class="handout">
<pre>
At Polimetrix we conduct surveys and political polls on the web at 
pollingpoint.com.  As such, our traffic increases significantly at 
election time. As the 2006 election approached, we realized that
our web traffic would soon be about 10x what it normally is. We
set about making sure our systems could handle that load. Today
we want to share some things we learned during this process.

<h1>The Paradox of Choice</h1>
<p>There are a lot of freakin' web frameworks...</p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/fws.png" style="margin-top:-30px" /></div>
	<div class="handout">
<pre>
It's an interesting--and great--time to be a python web developer..
A few years ago web frameworks were largely underdeveloped
and undocumented. Now we have mountains of frameworks and tools
available, many with excellent documentation and very active
user communities.

New ideas emerge every day about developing websites
in more elegant, more reusable, more efficient ways.  And with each of
these ideas, dozens more frameworks are born.

<h1>Fast Enough</h1>
<p>How fast is fast enough?</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>It bears repeating: don't prematurely optimize</li>
<li>Don't guess, know</li>
<li>Always focus on one "pinch point" at a time</li>
</ul>
	<div class="handout">
<pre>
Premature optimization is the root of all evil. All optimizations should
be based on an observed deficiency and should target a specific 
bottleneck in the application.  Good logging and load testing are required
to diagnose performance issues.  It is much easier to verify that an 
optimization works if one problem is addressed at a time, in serial.

<li>Static: 4000, dynamic (python): 400, db: 40</li>

<li>Hundreds to low thousands of dynamic page views 
is usually Good Enough&trade;</li>
<li>1000+ pages/s (86.4M pages/day) is a "caviar problem"</li>
</ul>
	<div class="handout">
<pre>
 * Note about "orders of magnitude" rule of thumb
 * Faster than 1000+ pages/s is out of scope for this talk, because
   it right at the outer limit of what very, very good single machine
   can do with an RDBMS.  (That gets into db replicates/clusters, 
   reads vs. writes, database partitioning, etc)
 * Maybe refer to brad@lj's talks for more on that (perl, but 
   we'll let that slide)

 We've tried to distill the process down to a couple of main ideas.
 Many of the optimization decisions we make are based on these two
 principles.

 to use other tools, proprietary or open source.

<h1>The Example Application</h1>

Flickr Killr
</p>
	<div class="handout">
<pre>
Show the app in a web browser (CGI version).
We put together a tiny web application that we will use to demonstrate 
and benchmark some of the methods we're discussing today. It's a 
database-backed, dynamically generated page that includes several static
files. The application looks kind of like photo organizing software 
(hence the name).  We've populated the database with over 100k users and 
over 1 million photos.
We have created a benchmarker script that simulates a browser requesting
this page. It makes requests to a list of URLs in rapid succession,
and is multithreaded to simulate concurrency. The benchmarker then
outputs some interesting stats, such as req/sec and average req time.

<img src="images/pc_cgi_v1.png" />
	<div class="handout">
<pre>
The web server invokes the Python interpreter and runs the CGI script.
The script prints its output to stdout, which is then written back to the
client as an HTTP response.
We realize that this is a somewhat outdated architecture, but PHP coders
work with only marginally better systems on a daily basis.
Do some benchmarking.

<pre>
There are a few different multi-programming models to consider here. In
general the threaded model can handle more concurrent connections than
the multiprocess model, and async can handle more than threaded. However,
concurrent connections is very often not the bottleneck. Other factors
should influence this decision. The methods we're trying to hilight in 
this talk apply no matter which model you choose.

	<div class="handout">
<pre>
This is already a huge improvement over the CGI version, but it's far
from perfect. For one, we're running this on a dual core machine, but 
Python's GIL prevents us from using the second core.
Another problem worth mentioning is that we are effectively fetching
the session from the database for each request. Since the session is
such an frequently-accessed resource, we prefer a more efficient session
store. We're not going to demo this today, but Jamie has written a
network-bound session daemon called Pear, which you can check out in
the cheese shop.

<p>Let's remedy some of these issues</p>
<ul class="incremental">
	<li>Run two instances of CherryPy</li>
	<li>Use a load balancer: nginx</li>
	<li>Make sure we adhere to Shared Nothing&trade;</li>
</ul>
	<div class="handout">
<pre>
We can run two (or more) instances of CherryPy to take advantage of
multi-core and multi-cpu architectures.
For your load balancer you almost certainly want to use the async MPM.
It has to deal with a lot of concurrent connections, and it has to do
so quickly.  
Shared Nothing means that each node is independent and doesn't keep any
application state locally. In the context of a web application this is
important because consecutive requests could be distributed to different
servers.
There is an added benefit of putting nginx out in front of CherryPy. 
Often the response needs to be slowly trickled back to a client on a low
bandwidth connection. With this setup, CherryPy can send it's response
to nginx very quickly across the local network (or on localhost) and
nginx can keep tons of connections open to the slow clients, or even
idle, between-request keepalive clients.
The CherryPy threads are free to handle new requests.
</pre>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>flickr-killr-users@flickrkillr.org</h1>
<p>Other options</p>
<ul class="incremental">
	<li>Run CherryPy in Apache with mod_python</li>
</ul>
	<div class="handout">
<pre>
The multiprocess MPM on the application server also takes advantage of 
multi-core and multi-CPU machines. This setup is not as memory efficient, 
however, and we'll need to get a reverse proxy involved anyway when 
we want to involve different physical machines.

</ul>
	<div class="handout">
<pre>
OS disk cache will help this problem, but it is still inefficient to have
a Python process reading and writing this data. Our total number of 
threads is finite, so we only want them working on generating dynamic 
content. This is another problem best solved by an asynchronous server.

<p>Let's remedy some of these issues</p>
<ul class="incremental">
	<li>Put the static files in a memory cache: memcached</li>
	<li>Tell nginx how to find them in memcached</li>
</ul>
	<div class="handout">
<pre>
For this demo we have written a CherryPy tool that inserts static
content into memcached as it is requested. memcached keeps the files
in memory and can handle tens of thousands of requests per second.
We will instruct nginx to look for files there first, and fall back
to CherryPy if the file is not found in the cache. The vast
majority of requests for static content will never even be seen
by CherryPy.
</pre>
	</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>www.flickrkillr-mashups.com</h1>
<p>Other options</p>
<ul class="incremental">
	<li>Squid and other reverse-proxy caches</li>
	<li>Use a fast web server like lighttpd, if your deployment includes it</li>
</ul>
	<div class="handout">
<pre>
Another caching option is to put a web cache out in front of the site
that automatically caches certain resources and intercepts requests as
they come in. This method makes your application completely unaware that
the cache even exists.
If you choose to use lighttpd as your reverse proxy and load balancer,
it might make sense to just let lighttpd serve static content from disk.
